# README Geographic Aggregations map
##Installation
Copy the repository content to a roject called Geo_Agg inside a package called mexbalia in the root package of Hana and activate it, or change all the routes in the html files and the Anonymous_Access.xssqlcc.

You need the sap.hana.xs.admin.roles::SQLCCAdministrator role to enable anonymous access, if you can't get that role or don't want anonymous acces, remove the anonymous configuration from .xsaccess.
